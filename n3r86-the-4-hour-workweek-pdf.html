As human economic and technological productivity has soared astronomically since the 1940's when the Fair Labor Standards Act created the 40 hour workweek, a sensible policy option that would naturally be considered in a healthy democratic society (as opposed to a plutocratic/kleptocratic one) would be to shorten the full time workweek ( at least linearly as economic and technological productivity grows exponentially.

I want to start counting. And I'd like to start being a better human.

I am working to remove all my unhealthy habits and moving to replace those voids with healthy habits. I figure this way, by the time I am out of the woods I'm fairly new to HR, after being promoted from within the company to train as office manager, so I apologize if this is a softball question. We have an employee that has used all of his paid time off for the year, we roll over per calendar year and front load all of their vacation on January 1, so he has quite awhile to go. We already know he is planning on taking more time off. Can we reduce his pay for those weeks?

Scenario: Restaurant fired its entire overnight cleaning staff because they realized they could pay their servers and bartenders 2 dollars an hour to do it after the doors close. Employees now end their shift sometimes 2 hours later, meaning there are 2 hours per day where tipping is impossible. Should employees then make minimum wage or are they averaged against what was tipped over the course of that day? EDIT: This is Pennsylvania- forgot to mention. (Thanks moderator bots!)

LBST 330-3: Selected Topics: The Politics of Working Time Summer 2018 Instructor: Tom Walker COURSE DESCRIPTION: Controversy over the regulation of the hours of work has marked labour relations from the earliest days of industrialization and sustained economic growth in Great Britain in the early nineteenth century. In Canada, Great Britain, and the United States, the enactment of major labour legislation and periods of intensified unionization have coincided with movements for the ten-hour.

According to the Department of Education (https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_211.60.asp), the national average for public school teachers in primary or secondary education in 2013 was ,383. The median household income for the same year was ,939 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Recent_trends).

I've always enjoyed taking a more personal approach to crafting than simply pouring gold and downtime into an item. There's something that much more satisfying designing an item out of materials you've gathered and chosen, than simply subtracting a number from your wealth. One of my players also shares this love for more personalised crafting and has also made a Forge Cleric (https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/DnDXL2017_Forge.pdf) PC for my campaign, which led to the discussion.

Second, this seems like a very political topic on the surface - it's not. It seems like something that will divide progressives and conservatives - it won't. 
Would you take more precautions on the playa if you found out the inorganic dust stayed in your lungs for life and was proven to be extremely toxic in the long-term? We need to feel free at the burn, but what if dancing in a crowd without a dust mask led to years of suffering or a shorter life, would you wear one? I am a complete amateur researching the health effects of playa dust, but what I've found so far provides real reasons to be careful. Last year was my first burn and I wish everyone.
