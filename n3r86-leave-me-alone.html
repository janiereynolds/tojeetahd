One day, I was shopping at the local Walmart and had my headphones in. These headphones are incredibly nice and a gift from my parents. I had just gotten off work and was in business casual, khakis and a plain grey polo. No logo. Nothing to indicate that I worked at Walmart. I was looking in the freezer section for some ice cream for dessert that night when someone yank my headphones off my head and they fall on the ground. Cue Karen starting to yell at me. "I have been trying He said, ‚ÄúFine. Suit yourself.‚Äù. 
22 Male here, sorry for barging in your sub ladies. I workout at my university gym and there‚Äôs this girl that hits the gym same time as me. On at least 5 occasions, she approached me and asked me questions about things such as form, a squat spot, and just mundane things like the time (there are 3 separate clocks on the walls). Thing is, I‚Äôm not exactly buff and most dudes in the gym probably know a lot more than I do. So there‚Äôs really no reason to ask me. I assumed she wanted to be friends. Let me start by saying that I do absolutely plan on talking to my wife about this, but I wanted a reality check first to see if my perspective on the issue is wrong. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and we have 2 kids, a 3 year old and a 6 month old. Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule Hello, I broke up with my boyfriend last month but now he won't leave me alone!!! He randomly shows up at my work and home EVERY DAY üò≠üò≠ I called the police and they told me to just keep a record of his communication. I am terrified! My dad told him not to come to the house, but hd threatened to beat my dad up!! I haven't been able to sleep last night. A little background: I have been a very responsible smoker for years, mostly the last 10 years (live in a state that is approved for medical use only). We dated for 4 years during which time I kept her separated from that (wouldn‚Äôt smoke when she came over on the weekends). We had a few discussions about it but she is very much against it. Our last big discussion was about a month before our wedding in October. During this discussion she told me her reason for hating it was ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt I lurk here often. On mobile. Yada Yada. So I use to work at Wal-Mart. Did a variety of things in my time there. It was an okay job. I liked it for the most part. There for a year and half. So I had this regular. We'd see her almost everyday. Well this took place after I left. I was browsing the mouthwash section looking to try something new. The regular came up to me. She asked me if we had some toothpaste brand in stock. Mind you I no longer worked there, and was in clear casual wear. My fianc√©‚Äôs mom unexpectedly turned up at our house yesterday. I answered the door and she was like ‚Äòis (my fianc√©) here?‚Äô.so I was like ‚Äòno he‚Äôs working‚Äô she goes ‚Äòwell I was near so I thought I‚Äôd come see if he was here seeing as he‚Äôs ignoring my phone calls‚Äô then she goes ‚Äòcan you call him and find out what time he‚Äôs going to be home please‚Äô üôÑ.So I call him and I‚Äôm like ‚Äòbabe, your mom is here, she wants to know what time you‚Äôre gonna be home and why you‚Äôve been ignoring her calls‚Äô. This older man has not been extremely persistent, but I asked him last semester to just leave me alone because I'm uncomfortable with older men and didn't want to talk to him for weeks, and he didn't. For context, I'm 19 and he's in his mid to late 20s. He told me I was "limiting myself" and tried to give me some sob story about how he "left Montenegro alone and will return to Montenegro alone". The very next class, he tried to sit next to me. I pushed the seat back in so he couldn't, and asked. Hi. So I am using a throw away cause on my real one it‚Äôs not hard to figure out who I am. To try and keep this short I(F25) have an ex(M 35) we dated for two years and he really can‚Äôt quite get the message. So I broke up with this guy in October and since then I have received numerous long emails about how much he misses me and loves me. I have seen him at a number of art shows that I showed my work at. He also gave me a chemical burn from something he put on a necklace that he returned First time posting but I need to vent and get this off my chest. My ex best friend had become so problematic and toxic I had to walk away. Backstory: We were friends from about year seven up until the last few months. She started working and I eventually heard nothing from her. I understood she had work and still tried to make as much for her as I could. She started leaving ne alone for everyone else and I still tried to justify it by saying she's allowed other friends I shouldn't be selfish.
