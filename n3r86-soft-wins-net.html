When I think of a class defensive midfielder, I think of Daniele De Rossi. So when EA dropped a Flashback De Rossi, I already knew I was doing this SBC. I could go on and on about this man irl, but you came here to see if De Rossi was worth spending around 250k on the best beard in football, so without further ado, let’s get into it.

Gren hurried down the wide corridor, his hooves clicking against the cold stone tiles in a frantic staccato rhythm that matched his agitated state of mind. ‘Who installs stone tiles on a naval flagship? How pompous. I mean really, who do these Dendracs think they are?’ Gren thought to himself.

There’s been a lot of off-on discussion about artifacts in the Mythgard Discord recently so I would like to contribute my two cents here in a more detailed post. To me, Mythgard is one of the most mechanically sound CCGs I’ve played, and I would go as far as to say the soundest out of all the “mana/minion” subgenre of CCGs.

What I love about feminism is its contradictory nature. On one hand it claims to help women, but on the other hand what it advocates for women makes their lives horrifically worse, if not outright wastes of lives. Education, for example, sucks. Yes, it may lead to higher incomes. Yes, it might make you "educated." But it still takes inordinate amounts of time and money to attain. It is not the panacea solution to all of life's problems, and more often than not leads to financial ruination. Hi guys. I’ve recently started playing ESL again after a long hiatus, and wanted to share my thoughts on the design direction, current state, and evolution of the game. For some context, I started playing ESL in Beta, made legend in Beta, played until The Dark Brotherhood, where I took a break then briefly returned for Heroes of Skyrim. I didn’t play ESL again until last November. I’m mostly going to talk about the game conceptionally/from a design standpoint, rather than talking about > I Know how hard it can be to find items for us large boys, here's a small list of items I've purchased and can validate that 1:1 fit, like many of you I order a bunch of stuff that when received I couldn't even put an arm in those things, so yeah I had to give them away to my sister so its a win for her, but I wanted to share this with the community since you guys have helped me so much, am new to this so please be kind and I'll do my best to go trough each item. # Introduction Welcome and Bienvenue to the sixth of nine season in reviews by none other than your Humble Rear Admiral!

All the information I've gathered has come from either Bombers Forums ( or Bombers.ca (https://www.bluebombers.com/). Let’s. Hey folks, AgentW back with another guide. I don’t often see Arena content on this subreddit but have seen the question “Is there a written Arena guide that I can look up?” asked several times in the CompHS Discord which you can join here (https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/5tx6i3/come_join_us_on_discord/). I’ve decided to (hopefully) fill that void by providing a 10,000 foot view of how to succeed in the modern Arena, especially through the lens of a primarily Constructed player.
